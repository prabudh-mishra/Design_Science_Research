      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p><i>Edited by Sumitkumar Sapoliya</i></p>
      <p>
        Design Science Research (DSR) is a research methodology that focuses on
        the creation and evaluation of innovative artifacts to address practical
        problems. It involves the systematic application of scientific and
        design principles to develop solutions that are both practical and
        contribute to theoretical knowledge in a particular domain
        <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        DSR aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing a
        structured approach to solving complex problems. Unlike traditional
        research approaches that primarily focus on understanding phenomena, DSR
        emphasizes the creation of artifacts as a means of advancing knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        An artifact is an object made by humans with the intention that has been
        used to address a practical problem. These artifacts serve as innovative
        ideas and solutions for the problem. They provide a practical and
        meaningful impact on the solution by testing and implementing it in
        real-world scenarios <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These artifacts contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge as
        they provide relevant data required by the researchers on a certain
        topic that is tested and trusted, hence making the research process
        quick and enhancing the existing knowledge of the topic
        <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.

      <h2>4. Design Science Research Process</h2>
      <p><i>Edited by Sumitkumar Sapoliya</i></p>
      <p>
        The DSR methodology consists of a systematic framework that guides
        researchers through a series of activities. These activities provide an
        organized approach to problem-solving and artifact development. The key
        activities in the DSR framework include explicating the problem,
        defining requirements, designing and developing the artifact,
        demonstrating the artifact, and evaluating the artifact.
      </p>

      <h3>4.1. Explicate Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Problem explication is a critical activity in DSR that aims to precisely
        define and justify a problem within a specific practice. This section
        offers a detailed understanding of problem explication and its
        importance in the DSR process by diving into three sub-activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first sub-activity focuses on expressing the problem in a precise
        manner. It is essential to ensure that different stakeholders have a
        shared understanding of the problem, enabling effective collaboration. A
        more precise problem definition reduces ambiguity, enabling stakeholders
        to work together towards a common goal. Furthermore, precise problem
        definitions make issues more manageable and facilitate the development
        of innovative solutions. However, the goal is to achieve a balance, as
        overly precise definitions may miss the intended target and restrict
        creative problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second sub-activity involves placing the problem in its context and
        highlighting its significance. Researchers consider the practice,
        stakeholders, environment, and negative consequences of not addressing
        the problem. This analysis helps justify the problem's importance based
        on stakeholder relevance, general interest, challenge, and originality.
        The problem should be important to stakeholders, have broader relevance
        beyond individual contexts, present a challenge without existing
        solutions, and ideally be an original problem that has not been raised
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third sub-activity involves identifying and understanding the
        underlying causes or root causes of the problem. It is a systematic
        approach that moves from symptoms to uncovering the fundamental causes
        of the problem. It enables researchers to address the underlying causes,
        leading to effective problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem explication is a crucial activity in the DSR process, ensuring a
        clear and precise understanding of the problem at hand
        <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
      </p>

        <img src="explicate_problem.jpg" alt="Explicate Problem" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 1</strong>: Explicate Problem <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>4.2. Define Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        The activity of defining requirements is a crucial step in the DSR
        methodology, aiming to outline an artifact that can effectively address
        the explicated problem. This activity delves into the process of
        defining requirements, like understanding the problem, identifying
        stakeholder requirements, and outlining the artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outlining the artifact involves making decisions about its type and
        description. Researchers choose the most suitable form of the artifact,
        such as constructs, models, methods, or instantiations, based on the
        problem, resources, and expected outcomes. The outline provides an
        initial understanding of the artifact's purpose, functionality, and
        design considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eliciting requirements involves identifying and gathering desired
        properties and features from stakeholders for the artifact. There are
        two types of requirements: functional and non-functional. Functional
        requirements specify the artifact's specific functionalities and
        capabilities that address the problem. Non-functional requirements focus
        on quality attributes like usability, performance, and security.
        Eliciting requirements requires stakeholder engagement, interviews,
        surveys, and analysis of existing practices. Accurate documentation of
        all relevant requirements is essential <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h3>4.3. Design and development of Artifact</h3>
      <p>
        The activity of designing and developing an artifact plays a crucial
        role in the DSR process. This section offers a comprehensive
        understanding of artifact design and development in DSR by exploring
        sub-activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sub-activity of imagine and brainstorm focuses on generating
        creative ideas and exploring potential solutions. Researchers engage in
        open and collaborative brainstorming sessions to foster innovation. By
        encouraging diverse perspectives and creative thinking, researchers can
        envision a wide range of possibilities to address the identified
        problem. This phase sets the foundation for generating innovative ideas
        that can lead to effective artifact design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Researchers conduct a systematic evaluation of promising ideas,
        considering feasibility, practicality, and potential impact. They
        identify the most promising ideas for further development, addressing
        the problem effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the sketch and build sub-activity, researchers transform selected
        ideas into tangible representations and prototypes. Sketching involves
        creating visual representations, diagrams, or mock-ups that illustrate
        the design and functionality of the artifact. Building focuses on
        constructing prototypes or developing software systems based on the
        chosen design. This sub-activity bridges the gap between abstract
        concepts and tangible artifacts, allowing researchers to iteratively
        refine and improve the artifact's design.
      </p>
      <p>
        The justify and reflect sub-activity evaluates artifacts for effective
        problem-solving by analyzing functionality, usability, efficiency, and
        alignment with defined requirements. Researchers compare and contrast
        artifacts based on predefined criteria, ensuring alignment with
        stakeholder needs and potential for problem-solving
        <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
      </p>
      <figure>

          <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>4.4. Demonstrate Artefact</h3>
      <p>
        Once the artifact is designed and developed, the next activity in the
        DSR method framework is demonstrating its functionality and usability.
        This activity involves showcasing the artifact to stakeholders and
        obtaining feedback on its effectiveness in addressing the problem. >
      </p>
      <p>
        The first sub-activity involves selecting or designing a case upon which
        the artifact will be applied and tested. The case can be a real-life
        scenario, a case from existing literature, or a fictitious case
        specifically designed for demonstration purposes. Real-life cases
        provide practical context, while fictitious cases offer the advantage of
        designing extreme conditions to showcase the viability and effectiveness
        of the artifact. Careful consideration is given to selecting a
        representative case for evaluating the artifact's capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second sub-activity focuses on applying the artifact to the chosen
        case and documenting the outcomes. Researchers use domain-specific
        knowledge to apply the artifact effectively. They evaluate how well the
        artifact addresses the problem within the case and document the results.
        The outcomes may include process improvements, better decision-making,
        or other positive impacts. This sub-activity validates the artifact's
        effectiveness in addressing the problem <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="demonstrate_artifact.jpg" alt="Demonstrate Artefact" />

          <strong>Figure 4</strong>: Demonstrate Artefact <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>4.5. Evaluate Artefact</h3>
      <p>
        The activity of evaluating an artifact in DSR is essential to assess its
        effectiveness in solving the explicated problem and fulfilling the
        defined requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first sub-activity involves analyzing the evaluation context to
        establish a basis for selecting appropriate goals and strategies.
        Researchers consider the constraints within the evaluation environment,
        such as available time, resources (people, budget), and access to users
        or organizations. Understanding the context helps researchers make
        informed decisions regarding the evaluation goals and strategies that
        align with the available resources and constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second sub-activity involves selecting evaluation goals and
        strategies, focusing on specific requirements, contextual knowledge,
        comparisons, side effects, and formative or summative evaluations.
        Researchers must consider factors like effectiveness, resources, time,
        and budget to select appropriate research strategies and methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final sub-activity focuses on designing and conducting the
        evaluation process, including setting up a laboratory, designing
        interview questions, selecting software, and ensuring compliance with
        research strategies and methods. Researchers execute the evaluation,
        applying the artifact, collecting data, analyzing results, and
        documenting outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        DSR aims to evaluate artifact development by solving the explicated
        problem and fulfilling defined requirements. By analyzing the evaluation
        context, selecting appropriate goals, and conducting assessments,
        researchers gain insights into the artifact's performance and
        effectiveness, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the
        field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The results of a design science project are typically communicated to
        researchers as well as to practitioner communities, which may include
        both technology-oriented and management-oriented audiences.Communicating
        results to researchers requires attention to rigor so that they can
        evaluate the results and build on them in future work

      <h2>7. Demonstration</h2>
      <p><i>Edited by Prabudh Mishra</i></p>
      <p>
        For the sake of demonstration, we had taken this scenario for a Customer
        Resource management (CRM) application: “During the recent financial
        years, it has been found that there was a lack of effective lead
        management and conversion tracking, leading to suboptimal sales
        performance and difficulty in identifying high-potential leads. Despite
        continuous training in sales management and data management, issues were
        still not getting resolved”.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the previous version, the developers used “waterfall” approaches
        where requirements were defined and validated before starting
        implementation and not changed until a version is completed and
        distributed to clients.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s break down the whole process in DSR’s process flow:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Explicate problem:</strong> After explicating the problem in the
        current version of the CRM application, it can be seen that there is
        inefficient customer data management and a lack of effective
        communication channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Define requirements:</strong> From the explicated problem, we
        created requirements to streamline customer data management, improve
        customer engagement and enhance the communication between customers and
        sales representatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Design and Develop artifacts:</strong> From the requirements
        obtained, we can create artifacts like Constructs, Models, and
        Activities that would make up the whole project and resolve the issues
        one by one. UI/UX design could be created as constructs, System
        architecture diagrams, and Wireframes as Models and combined with a
        working prototype as Actions that make up these artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Demonstrate artifacts:</strong> After the artifacts have been
        developed, we need to show them to the stakeholders. Now these artifacts
        could be demonstrated to stakeholders using the methods like User
        testing, Performance evaluation, Case studies, and comparison with other
        current CRM applications on the market for validation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Evaluate artifacts:</strong> After demonstrating the artifacts
        to the stakeholders, the artifacts will be tested on their usability by
        taking feedback from the users gathered during the demonstration phase,
        checking whether it has completed most of its objective of customer
        management and communication, and calculating the total impact on
        customer satisfaction. This whole determines its performance which is
        higher than its previous version as all the issues were solved before
        reaching to this phase.

      <p>
        After completing all the phases, we can see that the performance and
        usability of the CRM application went up by more than 20% as there was a
        proper flow of customer traffic data and they got assistance in managing
        their dashboards with the help of the sales representatives.

      <h2>8. Classical Methodologies</h2>
      <p><i>Edited by Prabudh Mishra</i></p>
      <p>
        There are other research techniques or methodologies other than DSR,
        which are used even before DSR was created and are still used to date.
        These methodologies are considered Classic research methodologies. These
        methodologies include Quantitative and qualitative research, Action
        research, Participatory design, and Case studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        These classic methodologies are used to understand the working of the
        topic and discover new knowledge regarding that topic. They are useful
        depending on the research questions and context as they are completely
        theoretical in nature.
      </p>

      <h3>8.1 DSR v/s Classical Methodologies</h3>
      <p>
        Both DSR and Classical methodologies are used for research purposes.
        There are many similarities in these methodologies, but their difference
        is what separates them and makes them useful for certain cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, DSR focuses on contributing directly to practice by creating
        artifacts that can be used in real-world contexts, while these classic
        methodologies contribute to theoretical knowledge. <a href="#r1">[1]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, the main objective of DSR is to create innovative solutions to
        real-world problems, while the objective of classic methodologies is to
        understand the working of that topic. <a href="#r1">[1]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, DSR is an iterative process that involves creating, testing,
        and refining artifacts in an ongoing cycle. Classic methodologies tend
        to be more linear in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fourthly, Both DSR and classic methodologies require rigor in research
        methods and techniques. However, DSR also emphasizes the rigor of the
        design process and the testing of artifacts in real-world contexts.
        <a href="#r3">[3]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, DSR uses specific evaluation criteria to assess the utility,
        quality, and effectiveness of the artifact. These criteria are often
        derived from established theories, best practices, or expert opinions,
        while classical methodologies typically rely on validity, reliability,
        and generalizability as key evaluation criteria. <a href="#r3">[3]</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Human-Centered Design:</strong> Emphasize human-centered design
        approaches in DSR by placing users at the center of artifact
        development. Investigate user needs, preferences, and experiences to
        create artifacts that better align with user expectations.
        <a href="#r3">[3]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Evaluation Methodologies:</strong> Develop and refine evaluation
        methodologies specific to DSR. Explore new approaches, metrics, and
        frameworks to assess the impact and value of design artifacts in
        real-world settings. <a href="#r1">[1]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> Examine the ethical
        implications of design artifacts and methodologies in DSR. Investigate
        ethical frameworks, guidelines, and best practices to ensure responsible
        and ethically sound design practices. <a href="#r3">[3]</a>
