      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p><i>Edited by Sumitkumar Sapoliya</i></p>
      <p>
        Design Science Research (DSR) is a research methodology that focuses on
        the creation and evaluation of innovative artifacts to address practical
        problems. It involves the systematic application of scientific and
        design principles to develop solutions that are both practical and
        contribute to theoretical knowledge in a particular domain
        <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        DSR aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing a
        structured approach to solving complex problems. Unlike traditional
        research approaches that primarily focus on understanding phenomena, DSR
        emphasizes the creation of artifacts as a means of advancing knowledge.

      <h2>6. Demonstration</h2>
      <p><i>Edited by Prabudh Mishra</i></p>
      <p>
        For the sake of demonstration, we had taken this scenario for a Customer
        Resource management (CRM) application: “During the recent financial
        years, it has been found that there was a lack of effective lead
        management and conversion tracking, leading to suboptimal sales
        performance and difficulty in identifying high-potential leads. Despite
        continuous training in sales management and data management, issues were
        still not getting resolved”.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the previous version, the developers used “waterfall” approaches
        where requirements were defined and validated before starting
        implementation and not changed until a version is completed and
        distributed to clients.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s break down the whole process in DSR’s process flow:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Explicate Problem:</strong> After explicating the problem in the
        current version of the CRM application, it can be seen that there is
        inefficient customer data management and a lack of effective
        communication channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Define Requirements:</strong> From the explicated problem, we
        created requirements to streamline customer data management, improve
        customer engagement and enhance the communication between customers and
        sales representatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Design and Develop Artefacts:</strong> From the requirements
        obtained, we can create Artefacts like Constructs, Models, and
        Activities that would make up the whole project and resolve the issues
        one by one. UI/UX design could be created as constructs, System
        architecture diagrams, and Wireframes as Models and combined with a
        working prototype as Actions that make up these artefacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Demonstrate Artefacts:</strong> After the Artefacts have been
        developed, we need to show them to the stakeholders. Now these artefacts
        could be demonstrated to stakeholders using the methods like User
        testing, Performance evaluation, Case studies, and comparison with other
        current CRM applications on the market for validation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Evaluate Artefacts:</strong> After demonstrating the artefacts
        to the stakeholders, the artefacts will be tested on their usability by
        taking feedback from the users gathered during the demonstration phase,
        checking whether it has completed most of its objective of customer
        management and communication, and calculating the total impact on
        customer satisfaction. This whole determines its performance which is
        higher than its previous version as all the issues were solved before
        reaching to this phase.
      </p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        After completing all the phases, we can see that the performance and
        usability of the CRM application went up by more than 20% as there was a
        proper flow of customer traffic data and they got assistance in managing
        their dashboards with the help of the sales representatives.

      <h2>7. Classical Methodologies</h2>
      <p><i>Edited by Prabudh Mishra</i></p>
      <p>
        There are other research techniques or methodologies other than DSR,
        which are used even before DSR was created and are still used to date.
        These methodologies are considered Classic research methodologies. These
        methodologies include Quantitative and qualitative research, Action
        research, Participatory design, and Case studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        These classic methodologies are used to understand the working of the
        topic and discover new knowledge regarding that topic. They are useful
        depending on the research questions and context as they are completely
        theoretical in nature.
      </p>

      <h3>7.1 DSR v/s Classical Methodologies</h3>
      <p>
        Both DSR and Classical methodologies are used for research purposes.
        There are many similarities in these methodologies, but their difference
        is what separates them and makes them useful for certain cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, DSR focuses on contributing directly to practice by creating
        artifacts that can be used in real-world contexts, while these classic
        methodologies contribute to theoretical knowledge. <a href="#r1">[1]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, the main objective of DSR is to create innovative solutions to
        real-world problems, while the objective of classic methodologies is to
        understand the working of that topic. <a href="#r1">[1]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, DSR is an iterative process that involves creating, testing,
        and refining artifacts in an ongoing cycle. Classic methodologies tend
        to be more linear in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fourthly, Both DSR and classic methodologies require rigor in research
        methods and techniques. However, DSR also emphasizes the rigor of the
        design process and the testing of artifacts in real-world contexts.
        <a href="#r3">[3]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, DSR uses specific evaluation criteria to assess the utility,
        quality, and effectiveness of the artifact. These criteria are often
        derived from established theories, best practices, or expert opinions,
        while classical methodologies typically rely on validity, reliability,
        and generalizability as key evaluation criteria. <a href="#r3">[3]</a>
      </p>
